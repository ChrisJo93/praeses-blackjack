# Cloning and Running

To clone the repo locally, open terminal, **_cd_** to desired directory and type **_gh repo clone https://github.com/ChrisJo93/praeses-blackjack.git_**

To run, cd into the directory containing the react application and type **_npm run_** in the command line.

## Code Tree

- src/ contains the React application
- src/assets contains resources such as images for the Blackjack Game.
- src/components is where the actual game logic exists.

The game code is fairly commented with cursory information for what each function does.
